	<p class="mt-5">
		I'm a self-taught full-stack engineer and I wrote my first line of code in '19. I created this
		site to share what <Link href="/projects" isUnderlined title="projects" />, <Link
			href="/changelogs"
			isUnderlined
			title="learnings"
		/>, and <Link href="/articles" isUnderlined title="thoughts" /> are currently taking my time and
		attention.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		Most of my experiences have been trial-by-fire as I solo-bootstrapped a business called <Link
			href="/projects/leadgeek-v2"
			isUnderlined
			title="Leadgeek"
		/> in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an entire suite of tools.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I'm still here ~{new Date().getFullYear() - 2020} years later, thanks mostly to trusty old Google
		and the deep desire not to make the same mistake twice
		<span role="img" aria-label="Sweat smile emoji">ðŸ˜…</span>. Now that Leadgeek is highly
		maintainable on the side, I'm looking for my next challenging project.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I picked up programming as a necessity for building products and was surprised to find that I
		fell in love with it. Through trial-and-error, I've become well-versed in the development
		requirements of modern applications.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I can handle authentication, process payments, send emails, preserve data in storage, and plug
		that all into a responsive, accessible, and intuitive front end.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I feel like my experience building products from scratch and selling them to real people has
		accelerated my learning and made me extremely well-rounded. At the same time, I've realized
		recently that I can only accomplish a finite amount building and marketing products by myself.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		Consequently, <mark

			problems on a bigger scale than I can accomplish completely on my own.</mark
