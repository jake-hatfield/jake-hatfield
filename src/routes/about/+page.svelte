	<p class="mt-5">
		I'm Jake Hatfield. I'm a self-taught full-stack engineer and I wrote my first line of code in
		nov '19. I created this site to share what <Link
			href="/changelogs"
			isUnderlined
			title="thoughts"
		/>, <Link href="/articles" isUnderlined title="learnings" />, and <Link
			href="/projects"
			isUnderlined
			title="projects"
		/> are currently taking my time and attention.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		Most of my experiences have been trial-by-fire as I bootstrapped a <Link
			href="https://leadgeek.io/vs/online-arbitrage-sourcing-list"
			isExternal
			isUnderlined
			title="online arbitrage sourcing list"
		/> in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an entire suite of tools.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I'm still here {new Date().getFullYear() - 2020}+ years later, thanks mostly to trusty old
		Google and the deep desire not to make the same idiotic mistake twice
		<span role="img" aria-label="Sweat smile emoji">üòÖ</span>.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I graduated from Texas A&M in '16 with a B.S. in Biology that I would love to use in conjunction
		with programming one day. Whether that will ever happen is TBD.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I now live in Houston, Texas with my wife <span role="img" aria-label="Woman emoji">üë©</span>,
		our daughter
		<span role="img" aria-label="Baby emoji">üë∂</span>, and our dog
		<span role="img" aria-label="Dog emoji">üêï</span>.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I picked up programming as a necessity for product development and was surprised to find that I
		fell in love with it.

			Now I'm trying to refine this skill by creating <i>and </i> publishing a project for every
			letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on "{String.fromCharCode(96 + projects.length)}."

	<p class="mt-3">
		Through trial-and-error, I've become well-versed in the development requirements of modern
		applications.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		I can handle authentication, process payments, send emails, preserve data in storage, and plug
		that all into a responsive, accessible, and intuitive front end.
