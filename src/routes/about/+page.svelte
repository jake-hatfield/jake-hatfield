			isUnderlined
			title="thoughts" />, <Link href="/articles" isUnderlined title="learnings" />, and <Link
			href="/projects"
			isUnderlined
			title="projects" /> are currently taking my time and attention.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		most of my experiences have been trial-by-fire as i bootstrapped a <Link
			href="https://leadgeek.io"
			isExternal
			isUnderlined
			title="solo business" /> in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an
		entire suite of tools.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		i'm still here {new Date().getFullYear() - 2020}+ years later, thanks mostly to trusty old
		google and the deep desire not to make the same idiotic mistake twice
