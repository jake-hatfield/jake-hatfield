		i'm jake hatfield. i'm a self-taught full-stack engineer and I wrote my first line of code in
		nov '19. i created this site to share what <Link
			href="/articles"
			isUnderlined
			title="learnings" />, <Link href="/changelog" isUnderlined title="thoughts" />, and <Link
			href="/projects"
			isUnderlined
			title="projects" /> are currently taking my time and attention.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		most of my experiences have been trial-by-fire as i bootstrapped a <Link
			href="https://leadgeek.io"
			isExternal
			isUnderlined
			title="solo business" /> in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an
		entire suite of tools.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		i'm still here 2+ years later, thanks mostly to trusty old google and the deep desire not to
		make the same idiotic mistake twice

	<p class="mt-3">
		i graduated from texas a&m in '16 with a b.s. in biology that i would love to use in conjunction
		with programming one day. whether that will ever happen is tbd.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		i now live in houston, texas with my wife <span role="img" aria-label="Woman emoji">üë©</span>,
		our daughter
		<span role="img" aria-label="Baby emoji">üë∂</span>, and our dog
		<span role="img" aria-label="Dog emoji">üêï</span>.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		i picked up programming as a necessity for product development and was surprised to find that i
		fell in love with it.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		now i'm trying to refine this skill by creating an application for every letter of the alphabet.
		right now I'm on "d."
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		through trial-and-error, i've become well-versed in the development requirements of modern
		applications.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-3">
		i can handle authentication, process payments, send emails, preserve data in storage, and plug
		that all into a responsive, accessible, and intuitive interface on the front end that fills a
		real need (hopefully).
