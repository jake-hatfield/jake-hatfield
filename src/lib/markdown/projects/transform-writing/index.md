## Summary

## Goals

## Results

> "During the initial stages of Transform Writing's formation, we encountered challenges with three different website developers who were unable to handle the complexity of the project. I approached Jake with our concerns and inquired whether our expectations for the website were unreasonable.
>
> <br/> Transform Writing is a platform for students to submit their written assignments for proofreading and light editing. Each student must have an account that provides a private upload portal for their documents. The Transform administrators must be able to download the submitted documents and return the proofed version to the respective students.
> <br/><br/> In addition, the website needed a clean and user-friendly interface that would enable first-time customers to navigate easily while enjoying an appealing page design and layout.
>
> <br/><br/> After carefully evaluating the project's requirements, Jake assured me that he could complete the project without any issues. Moreover, he proposed modifications to key functionalities that made the administrative process more efficient.
>
> <br/><br/> For instance, before Jake's revisions, Transform's administrators were required to access each student's account separately to verify submissions and upload/download the relevant documents. However, Jake suggested a more streamlined approach by designing an admin page that consolidates allsubmissions. The administrators can download the documents from a single admin page, eliminating the need to interact with hundreds of account pages.
>
> <br/><br/> Furthermore, Jake established a notification system for both students and Transform's administrators. Students receive updates through customizable text messages or emails, while the admin team receives notifications in their Slack channel whenever a new submission appears in the system. This is a significant breakthrough as it eliminates the need for periodic manual checks, especially since Transform guarantees 24-hour turnaround times to its customers.
>
> <br/><br/> Throughout the development process, Jake proactively sought our input and feedback, which enabled us to make timely revisions and course corrections as required.
>
> <br/><br/> The final product is a remarkable asset to our company, offering unparalleled convenience and efficiency, enhancing customer experience, and maintaining our reputation among existing clients.
>
> <br/><br/> We are confident that Jake will excel in handling similarly complex projects, and we will undoubtedly consult him for any future website development requirements."
