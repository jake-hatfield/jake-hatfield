## Summary

I'm currently building a React Native app for composing and sharing rap verses. Features include a dictionary and thesaurus API, syllable counter, and GPT-3-powered completion of user input using consonance, slant rhymes, onomatopoeia, etc. Users can share their rap lyrics as well as view and like other raps shared for public discovery.

The GPT-powered feature is up and running, which you can check out on <Link href="https://github.com/jake-hatfield/doom-scheme-api" isExternal isUnderlined title="my Github"/>. Now all that's left is building the app itself, which you can track via the <Link href="https://github.com/jake-hatfield/doom-scheme" isExternal isUnderlined title="repo"/> and my [changelogs](/changelogs).

All the other projects on this site are in production and documented [here](/projects).
