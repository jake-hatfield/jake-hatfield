## In progress

I'm ready to start applying for software engineer jobs. My day-to-day now will primarily consist of submitting applications while chipping away at Doom Scheme, which I'll be tracking in these changelogs.

Since I'm a self-taught programmer and have been working completely solo for the past 3 years, I don't really know what to expect for the interview process.

Therefore, a decent chunk of my time each day will also be spent on studying algorithms. Unfortunately, it's just not what I've had time to teach myself since most of my knowledge has been highly pragmatic and as-needed. I just haven't needed to invert a binary tree yet. üò≥

I figure that if the interviews doesn't require me to know this information, I'll at least have widened my knowledge on a topic I didn't previously have much experience in. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm just going to take it one step at a time...
