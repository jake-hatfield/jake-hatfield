### Howdy 👋

I'm [Jake](https://jake-hatfield.com). I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer and I wrote my first line of code in Nov '19. Most of my experience has been trial-by-fire as I bootstrapped a solo business in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an entire suite of tools. I'm still here 2+ years later, thanks mostly to trusty old Google and the deep desire not to make the same idiotic mistake twice 😅.

I graduated from [Texas A&M](https://www.tamu.edu/) in '16 with a B.S. in Biology that I would love to use in conjunction with programming one day. I now live in Houston, Texas with my wife 👩, our daughter 👶, and our dog 🐕.
