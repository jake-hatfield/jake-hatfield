# Jake Hatfield Portfolio

This is my [professional portfolio](https://jake-hatfield.com) to showcase what projects I'm working on, what technologies I have experience with, and what currently interests me.

Here's the tech stack I used to build it:

- 💖 SvelteKit
- ⌨️ TypeScript
- ✉️ SendGrid
- ⬛ Carbon Icons
- 🧪 Vitest/Playwright (with Github Actions CI)
- 📷 Custom image enhancements (converting files to .webp and upscaling on load)

This code is not to be reproduced and is intended for Jake Hatfield's purposes only.
