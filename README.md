### Howdy 👋

I'm [Jake](https://jake-hatfield.com). I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer and I wrote my first line of code in '19. Most of my experience has been trial-by-fire as I bootstrapped a solo business in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an entire suite of tools. I'm still here ~3 years later, thanks mostly to trusty old Google and the deep desire not to make the same mistake twice 😅.

I graduated from [Texas A&M](https://www.tamu.edu/) in '16 with a B.S. in Biology that I would love to use in conjunction with programming one day. Whether that will ever happen is TBD.
