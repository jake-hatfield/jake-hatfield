# Howdy 👋

I'm [Jake](https://jake-hatfield.com). I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer and I wrote my first line of code in '19. Most of my experience has been trial-by-fire as I bootstrapped a solo business in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an entire suite of tools. I'm still here ~3 years later, thanks mostly to trusty old Google and the deep desire not to make the same mistake twice 😅.

> The work I'm most proud of is in private repos. 👇 Email me to request access to view that code.
