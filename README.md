# Howdy 👋

I'm [Jake](https://jake-hatfield.com). I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer and I wrote my first line of code in '19. Most of my experience has been trial-by-fire as I bootstrapped a solo business in '20 that has evolved from a spreadsheet with custom macros into an entire suite of tools.
